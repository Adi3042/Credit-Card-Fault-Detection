### Advanced Fraud Detection Models ü§ñ

The system utilizes sophisticated machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions. These models are designed to identify anomalies with high accuracy.

#### Web Application üåê

The project includes a web-based interface for easy interaction with the fraud detection system. Users can input transaction details and receive predictions through a user-friendly web application.

- **Input Form:** Users can enter transaction details such as credit limit, demographic information, payment history, and bill amounts.
- **Fraud Detection Prediction:** The application applies a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of fraud.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web app features a clean and intuitive design for straightforward data entry and result viewing.
- **Background Image:** The app incorporates a visually appealing background to enhance the user experience.

### Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

The dataset used in the Credit Card Fault Detection project contains various attributes related to credit card transactions. This dataset is utilized to train machine learning models for detecting fraudulent activities.

#### Attributes in the Dataset:

- `LIMIT_BAL`: Credit limit of the cardholder.
- `SEX`: Gender of the cardholder (e.g., male, female).
- `EDUCATION`: Level of education of the cardholder (e.g., graduate, undergraduate).
- `MARRIAGE`: Marital status of the cardholder (e.g., married, single).
- `AGE`: Age of the cardholder.
- `PAY_0` to `PAY_6`: Payment status for the past 6 months (-1 = pay duly, 1 = payment delay for one month, 2 = payment delay for two months, etc.).
- `BILL_AMT1` to `BILL_AMT6`: Bill statement amount for the past 6 months.
- `PAY_AMT1` to `PAY_AMT6`: Amount paid in the past 6 months.
- `default payment next month`: Indicator of whether the cardholder defaulted on payment in the next month (1 = yes, 0 = no).
